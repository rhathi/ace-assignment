# faceapp

This is a Flutter project that detects faces from the image and provides the count of it. It makes use of Google ML Kit. You have to import the kit as a dependency and use its SDK to perform face detection.
Image picker is used to upload an image to the device from either gallary or camera and then the face detection process returns the list of faces. The program simply outputs the length of the list as a count.
